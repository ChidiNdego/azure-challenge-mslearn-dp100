    "# Use Automated Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many kinds of machine learning algorithm that you can use to train a model, and sometimes it's not easy to determine the most effective algorithm for your particular data and prediction requirements. Additionally, you can significantly affect the predictive performance of a model by preprocessing the training data, using techniques such as normalization, missing feature imputation, and others. In your quest to find the *best* model for your requirements, you may need to try many combinations of algorithms and preprocessing transformations; which takes a lot of time and compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning enables you to automate the comparison of models trained using different algorithms and preprocessing options. You can use the visual interface in [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml/azure.com) or the SDK to leverage this capability. The SDK gives you greater control over the settings for the automated machine learning experiment, but the visual interface is easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you start\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the latest version of the **azureml-sdk** and **azureml-widgets** packages, you'll need the **azureml-train-automl** package to run the code in this notebook. Run the cell below to verify that it is installed."

    "#### Specify data for training\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated machine learning is designed to enable you to simply bring your data, and have Azure Machine Learning figure out how best to train a model from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the Automated Machine Learning user interface in Azure Machine Learning studio, you can create or select an Azure Machine Learning dataset to be used as the input for your automated machine learning experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the SDK to run an automated machine learning experiment, you can submit the data in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Specify a dataset or dataframe of training data that includes features and the label to be predicted.\n",
    "    Optionally, specify a second validation data dataset or dataframe that will be used to validate the trained model. if this is not provided, Azure Machine Learning will apply cross-validation using the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Specify a dataset, dataframe, or numpy array of X values containing the training features, with a corresponding y array of label values.\n",
    "    Optionally, specify X_valid and y_valid datasets, dataframes, or numpy arrays of X_valid values to be used for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explore preprocessing steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated machine learning uses scikit-learn pipelines to encapsulate preprocessing steps with the model. You can view the steps in the fitted model you obtained from the best run using the code above like this:\n",
